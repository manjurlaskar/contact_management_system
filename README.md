This project is a **full-stack web-based Contact Management System**, developed using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL**. The system facilitates efficient management of contact information, including capabilities to add, update, delete, categorize, and search contacts. The application provides an intuitive and responsive user interface alongside robust backend logic and secure database operations.

The system is intended as an academic demonstration of a CRUD-based (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application with group management and real-time search functionality.
